# Outbound Prospecting System Context

## Project Overview
We are building a fully automated outbound prospecting system that finds, qualifies, and contacts companies that are deploying AI agents and autonomous workflows and therefore need governance infrastructure like Engram.

## Key Features
- **Discovery**: Continuously discovers companies from public sources.
- **Scraping & Detection**: Scrapes websites and documentation to detect agent deployment and risk signals.
- **Scoring**: Scores companies based on how well they match the ideal customer profile (ICP).
- **Prospecting**: Identifies relevant technical decision makers.
- **Email Generation & Verification**: Generates and verifies emails.
- **Outreach**: Sends personalized outreach messages.
- **Tracking & Classification**: Tracks replies and classifies interest levels.
- **Pipeline Management**: Updates the pipeline automatically.

## Goal
A self-sustaining lead generation engine tailored to AI agent security buyers.
