Hi Michael,

I’ve been following Kore.ai and really like to see that you're deploying autonomous agents.

I’m currently working on a small startup, Engram, focused on runtime governance for autonomous agents — basically, helping teams understand and manage data privacy risks like HIPAA.

This isn’t a pitch — I’m just trying to learn from teams running real agent systems. I’d love to hear how your team thinks about these tricky situations and share a few insights I’ve seen work for other small AI teams.

Would you be open to a very quick 10-minute chat? Totally informal, just a conversation.

Thanks so much,
Kwstas
